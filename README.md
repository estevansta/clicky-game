Spongebob-Themed Clicky React.js app for Nu-coding bootcamp

## About Clicky-Game

In this game, users start with a score of 0. The app will render multiple images that have different spongebob characters(possibly just different spongebob's) and when users click on an image, the score will increment while all the images will shuffle and change order. The objective of the game is to avoid clicking on repeated images to increment the score til the user wins, when the user clicks on an already clicked "true" image; the game score will restart along with reshuffling the images again.
